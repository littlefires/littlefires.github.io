During this whole Covid-19 thing, I was trying to think of a way that I could help. Luckily I came across this project by Jeff Triplett - it’s a way to highlight any major local restaurants. Luckily it’s on github, so I forked the project and starting throwing in my old data. There were a few technical lessons along the way, but I’m optimistic to be putting something out there to help our small businesses in the valley. Those will be below, but I’d appreciate it if you were to go to the site and enter your favorite local restaurant, if you’re a vegas local!
